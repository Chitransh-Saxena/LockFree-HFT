# 🔥 **Phase 1: Formalized Problem Statement**

### 🎯 Core Goal:

Build a **lock-free matching engine**:

* Limit order book for **bid/ask**
* Handle:

    * Order placement
    * Order cancellation
    * Order modification
    * Snapshot view of order book at any point
* Performance target:

    * 1 million orders/sec
    * per-stock latency < 1 ms
    * 32 stocks concurrently
    * < 5 GB heap usage

### 🎛 Required capabilities:

1. **Place order** (buy/sell, qty, price)
2. **Cancel order** (by ID)
3. **Modify order** (change qty/price)
4. **Match engine**: find opposing orders and match
5. **Snapshot API** (consistent read of order book)
6. **Trade feed**: publish matched trades (zero-copy ring buffer)

# 🔥 **Phase 2: Architectural Constraints**

### ⚠️ Hard Constraints:

✅ No global locks
✅ No blocking queues
✅ Use only CAS, volatile, and atomic structures
✅ All data structures GC-friendly
✅ False-sharing minimized
✅ Thread-safe snapshot view
✅ Real-time publish-subscribe for matched trades

### 💡 Design Patterns to use:

* **Observer** → trade feed
* **State** → order lifecycle
* **Memento** → consistent snapshot
* **Singleton Pool** → object pooling to avoid GC

# 🔥 **Phase 3: High-Level System Design**

### 🧩 Core Components:

| Component          | Description                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `OrderBook`        | One per stock (32 in total)          |
| `Order`            | Order object (BUY or SELL)           |
| `MatchingEngine`   | Match loop, runs per stock thread    |
| `TradePublisher`   | Publishes trade events               |
| `OrderSnapshot`    | Point-in-time view of the order book |
| `OrderIdGenerator` | Generates globally unique order IDs  |
| `OrderPool`        | Object pool for `Order` instances    |
| `RingBuffer`       | Zero-copy queue for trade publishing |

# 🔥 **Phase 4: Detailed Technical Questions (for YOU to answer!)**

1️⃣ **Data Structures**

* What data structure should hold active BUY/SELL orders? (sorted linked list, skiplist, flat array?)
* How to implement it lock-free?

2️⃣ **ABA problem**

* If you pop and push to a linked list with CAS, how to avoid ABA?
* Should you use version counters?

3️⃣ **Thread model**

* One thread per stock? Or global thread pool?
* How to avoid starvation?

4️⃣ **Snapshot consistency**

* How to snapshot an active CAS-updated list without global lock?

5️⃣ **GC**

* How to tune object pool size?
* Which objects to pool?
* How to avoid **old-gen promotion**?

6️⃣ **False sharing**

* How to pad cache lines to avoid false sharing between CPU cores?

7️⃣ **Progress guarantees**

* How to detect that no thread is "starving" others?
* Should you use yield / backoff?

# 🔥 **Phase 5: Implementation Plan**

### 1️⃣ Setup:

* Java 17 project
* Package structure:

  ```
  com.hft.orderbook
      |-- engine
      |-- model
      |-- snapshot
      |-- pubsub
      |-- util
      |-- test
  ```

### 2️⃣ Initial Milestones:

* v0.1 → single-threaded matching engine
* v0.2 → add lock-free structure
* v0.3 → CAS-based order insert/modify/cancel
* v0.4 → zero-copy ring buffer for trade feed
* v0.5 → snapshot API
* v0.6 → concurrency testing
* v0.7 → GC tuning, latency profiling
* v0.8 → final test suite + benchmark

---

# 🔥 **Phase 6: Test Plan**

### Test goals:

* Functional correctness
* Concurrent correctness
* Memory stability (no leak)
* Latency per order < 1 ms
* Throughput >= 1M orders/sec
* Snapshot accuracy
* Order starvation test

### Deep test ideas:

✅ Stress with 100 threads placing/cancelling orders
✅ ABA detection under rapid cancel/modify
✅ Snapshot "mid storm"
✅ Trade publishing latency under load
✅ GC log analysis for pause times

---

# 🔥 **Phase 7: Metrics to track**

* Orders/sec throughput
* Avg latency per order
* 99th percentile latency
* Memory usage (heap)
* GC pause times
* CPU usage per core
* False sharing detection (perf counters)

---

# 🚀 **Phase 8: What to do now**

👉 Step 1: Confirm if you'd like me to generate the following:
1️⃣ Full **package + class skeleton**
2️⃣ Deep test **checklist**
3️⃣ **Concurrency questions doc** for daily tracking
4️⃣ **Benchmark harness** skeleton (JMH or manual)

👉 Step 2: Once ready, we will start coding from v0.1 phase upward.
👉 I will also help you step-by-step with *exact JVM flags*, *GC tuning*, *perf validation*, *JFR analysis*.

If you like, I can generate the full **Phase 1–8 starter kit**, so you can start working on it today.
Shall I proceed? 🚀
